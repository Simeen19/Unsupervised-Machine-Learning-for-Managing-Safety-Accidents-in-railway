# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-for-Managing-Safety-Accidents-in-railway
We use machine learning to keep trains safe by learning normal patterns of speed, vibration, and engine temperature from unlabeled data. The system detects unusual changes, like sudden spikes or overheating and alerts the team early to prevent accidents before they happen.
